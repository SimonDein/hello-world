Testing version control on GitHub

Hi! I'm Simon, an experienced high end retoucher, and now also a learning developer!
When i'm not working with images or studying, i like to skate, listen to music, being with my friends or drinking coffee.

Over the last year i've gradually grown a bigger interest in design and development - so much in fact, that i've decided to change career, and gone half time to pursue the goal!
